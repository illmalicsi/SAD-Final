# Booking Notification System Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive notification system has been implemented to notify customers when their bookings are confirmed or rejected.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Notification Service (`notificationService.js`)
A centralized service for managing user notifications with the following capabilities:

- **Create Notifications**: Send notifications to specific users by email
- **Get Notifications**: Retrieve all notifications or filter by user
- **Mark as Read**: Individual or bulk marking of notifications
- **Delete Notifications**: Remove individual or all user notifications
- **Specialized Methods**:
  - `notifyBookingConfirmed()`: Sends confirmation notification with booking details
  - `notifyBookingRejected()`: Sends rejection notification
  - `notifyBookingCancelled()`: Sends cancellation notification

### 2. Booking Management Component (`BookingManagement.jsx`)
A new admin component for managing booking requests:

- **View All Bookings**: Filter by status (All, Pending, Approved, Rejected)
- **Approve Bookings**: One-click approval with automatic customer notification
- **Reject Bookings**: One-click rejection with automatic customer notification
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses localStorage events to sync across components
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows loading states and success/error messages

### 3. Dashboard Integration
Updated the main dashboard to include:

- **Notifications Page**: Display user-specific notifications with:
  - Unread count badge
  - Mark as read/unread functionality
  - Delete individual notifications
  - Mark all as read option
  - Time-ago display (e.g., "2 hours ago")
  - Color-coded by notification type (success, error, warning, info)

- **Booking Management Menu**: Added to the Management section (admin only)
- **Real-time Notification Count**: Badge on bell icon shows unread count
- **Auto-refresh**: Checks for new notifications every 10 seconds

## How It Works

### When a Booking is Approved:

1. Admin goes to **Dashboard â†’ Bookings** (admin only)
2. Admin clicks **"Approve & Notify"** button on a pending booking
3. System updates booking status to 'approved' in localStorage
4. `NotificationService.notifyBookingConfirmed()` is called
5. Notification is created with:
   - Title: "Booking Confirmed! ðŸŽ‰"
   - Message: Details about the service, date, and time
   - Type: success
   - User email: Customer's email from booking
6. Customer sees notification in their Dashboard â†’ Notifications
7. Unread badge appears on bell icon

### When a Booking is Rejected:

1. Admin clicks **"Reject"** button on a pending booking
2. System updates booking status to 'rejected'
3. `NotificationService.notifyBookingRejected()` is called
4. Customer receives rejection notification

## Data Storage

All notifications are stored in `localStorage` under the key `'userNotifications'` with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  id: timestamp,
  userEmail: "customer@email.com",
  type: "success|error|warning|info",
  title: "Notification Title",
  message: "Notification message",
  data: { bookingId, service, date, ... },
  read: false,
  createdAt: "ISO date string"
}
```

## User Experience

### For Customers:
- Receive instant notifications when bookings are approved/rejected
- View all notifications in Dashboard â†’ Notifications
- See unread count at a glance
- Mark notifications as read
- Delete old notifications
- Clear all notifications

### For Admins:
- Manage all booking requests in one place
- Filter bookings by status
- Approve/reject with one click
- Automatic customer notification
- Visual confirmation of actions

## Components Modified

1. **`dashboard.jsx`**:
   - Added BookingManagement import
   - Added NotificationService import
   - Added booking-management route
   - Updated notifications display to use real data
   - Added unread notification count badge
   - Added real-time notification loading

2. **Created Files**:
   - `services/notificationService.js` - Core notification logic
   - `Components/BookingManagement.jsx` - Booking approval UI

## Testing

To test the notification system:

1. Log in as a customer and create a booking
2. Log out and log in as admin
3. Go to Dashboard â†’ Bookings
4. Approve or reject the booking
5. Log out and log back in as the customer
6. Go to Dashboard â†’ Notifications
7. You should see the notification about your booking status

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Email notifications (requires backend integration)
- Push notifications
- Notification preferences/settings
- Notification categories/filters
- Sound alerts for new notifications
- In-app toast notifications

# Booking Persistence Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
Approved bookings were reverting to "pending" status after logout or page refresh because:
1. Bookings were only stored in browser's localStorage
2. No database table existed for bookings
3. No backend API endpoints for booking management
4. Frontend components weren't syncing with a persistent data source

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
Created `database/bookings_table.sql`:
- New `bookings` table with proper schema
- Fields: booking_id, user_id, customer_name, email, phone, service, date, start_time, end_time, location, estimated_value, status, notes, timestamps
- Foreign keys to users table
- Indexes for performance (user_id, status, date, email)
- Status enum: 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'cancelled'

### 2. Backend API Routes
Created `backend/routes/bookings.js`:
- **GET /api/bookings** - Get all bookings (admin)
- **GET /api/bookings/user/:email** - Get bookings by customer email
- **POST /api/bookings** - Create new booking
- **PUT /api/bookings/:id/status** - Update booking status (approve/reject)
- **DELETE /api/bookings/:id** - Delete a booking

### 3. Backend Server Integration
Updated `backend/server.js`:
- Added bookings routes import
- Registered `/api/bookings` endpoint

### 4. Frontend Updates

#### BookingManagement.jsx
Changed from localStorage-only to API-first:
- `loadBookings()` - Now fetches from API using authentication token
- `updateBookingStatus()` - Makes PUT request to backend to persist status changes
- Still uses localStorage as cache but reads from API on load
- Proper error handling and user notifications

#### Booking.jsx
Updated to save new bookings to database:
- `handleSubmit()` - Now POSTs to API endpoint
- `getStoredBookings()` - Fetches from API first, falls back to localStorage
- Added useEffect to load bookings asynchronously on mount
- Listens for booking updates from other components

### 5. Migration Script
Created `backend/scripts/migrateBookings.js`:
- Automated database table creation
- Uses existing database configuration
- Proper error handling and logging

## How It Works Now

### Creating a Booking:
1. User fills out booking form
2. Frontend POSTs to `/api/bookings`
3. Backend validates and inserts into database
4. Returns booking with database ID
5. Frontend updates UI with confirmed booking

### Approving/Rejecting a Booking:
1. Admin clicks approve/reject button
2. Frontend PUTs to `/api/bookings/:id/status` with authentication
3. Backend updates database with new status and approval timestamp
4. Database transaction persists the change
5. Frontend reloads from API to show updated status
6. Customer notification is sent

### Page Refresh/Logout:
1. On component mount, frontend calls `/api/bookings`
2. Backend queries database for all bookings
3. Returns current state from database
4. Frontend displays accurate, persisted data
5. **Approved bookings remain approved** ✅

## Files Modified

### Created:
- `database/bookings_table.sql`
- `backend/routes/bookings.js`
- `backend/scripts/migrateBookings.js`

### Modified:
- `backend/server.js` - Added bookings routes
- `dbemb/src/Components/BookingManagement.jsx` - API integration
- `dbemb/src/Components/Booking.jsx` - API integration

## Testing Steps

1. **Run Database Migration:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node scripts/migrateBookings.js
   ```

2. **Restart Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Test Booking Creation:**
   - Go to Booking page
   - Fill out form
   - Submit
   - Verify booking appears in BookingManagement

4. **Test Approval Persistence:**
   - Go to BookingManagement
   - Approve a booking
   - Refresh page
   - **Verify booking stays approved** ✅
   - Logout and login
   - **Verify booking stays approved** ✅

5. **Test Rejection:**
   - Reject a booking
   - Refresh page
   - Verify status persists

## API Authentication

All booking management endpoints (GET all, PUT status, DELETE) require:
- Valid JWT token in Authorization header
- Format: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- Token obtained from login

Public endpoints (no auth required):
- POST /api/bookings (create booking)
- GET /api/bookings/user/:email (view own bookings by email)

## Database Schema Details

```sql
CREATE TABLE bookings (
  booking_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  user_id INT NULL,
  customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  phone VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  service VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  start_time TIME NOT NULL,
  end_time TIME NOT NULL,
  location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  estimated_value DECIMAL(10,2),
  status ENUM('pending','approved','rejected','cancelled'),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  approved_by INT NULL,
  approved_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);
```

## Status Flow

```
Customer Books -> pending
              ↓
Admin Reviews → approved → stays approved permanently ✅
              ↓
            rejected → stays rejected permanently
```

## Benefits

✅ Bookings persist across sessions
✅ Approval status saved to database
✅ Multi-user support (different admins can see same data)
✅ Audit trail (who approved, when approved)
✅ Proper data validation
✅ RESTful API design
✅ Error handling and user feedback
✅ Database-backed reliability

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add pagination for large booking lists
2. Add booking search/filter functionality
3. Email notifications on approval/rejection
4. Booking history/logs
5. Export bookings to CSV/PDF
6. Calendar view integration
7. Conflict detection for double bookings
8. Booking cancellation workflow

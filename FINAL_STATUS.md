# ✅ FINAL STATUS - Booking Persistence FULLY WORKING!

## 🎉 ALL ISSUES RESOLVED!

### The Critical Fix:
**Changed database schema to allow NULL for user_id**
```sql
ALTER TABLE bookings MODIFY user_id INT NULL;
```

This was the root cause - customer bookings don't have user accounts, so user_id was NULL, but the database didn't allow it!

## ✅ BOTH SERVERS RUNNING

### Backend (Port 5000)
```
✅ Database connected successfully
🚀 Server running on port 5000
📊 Health check: http://localhost:5000/api/health
🔐 Auth endpoint: http://localhost:5000/api/auth
```

### Frontend (Port 3000)
```
✅ Compiled successfully!
🌐 Local: http://localhost:3000

## 💾 Database Verification

You can verify bookings are in the database:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\limni\Downloads\SAD-Final-main (2)\SAD-Final-main\backend"
node -e "const {pool} = require('./config/database'); pool.query('SELECT booking_id, customer_name, email, status FROM bookings').then(([rows]) => { console.table(rows); process.exit(); });"
```

Expected output:
```
┌─────────┬────────────┬───────────────┬─────────────┬──────────┐
│ (index) │ booking_id │ customer_name │ email       │ status   │
├─────────┼────────────┼───────────────┼─────────────┼──────────┤
│ 0       │ 1          │ 'Test User'   │ 'test@...'  │ 'pending'│
│ 1       │ 2          │ 'Your Booking'│ 'your@...'  │ 'approved'│
└─────────┴────────────┴───────────────┴─────────────┴──────────┘
```
